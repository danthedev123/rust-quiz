# rust-quiz
My first rust app for command line - gives you questions to answer from a file


## Making a questions file
Create a file in the quizzes folder and format your question by putting a colon inbetween the question and answer. For example,
```
Is the earth flat?:No
```

### TODO
- [ ] General improvements
- [ ] Better handling of questions files
